# Problem of the Week (POW) - Submissions

This repository contains my weekly submissions for the "Problem of the Week" (POW) coding challenge, organized by Prof. Mohd. Amir Khan at GLA University.

# Folder Structure : 

The repository is organized weekly. Each week's folder contains sub-folders for each problem, which in turn contain separate folders for each approach (Naive, Optimal, etc.).

POW-Repository/
└── week1/
    ├── Problem1_FolderName/
    │   ├── NaiveApproach/

    │   │   └── README.md

    │       ├── CodeFile.java
    │       └── README.md

Each approach's dedicated `README.md` file contains a detailed explanation of the logic and its time/space complexity.
