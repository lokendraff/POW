Finding Step Words: An Efficient Approach
This project contains my solution for the "Step Words Finder" problem, a fun challenge originally asked by Pivotal.

The Challenge
The goal is to analyze a word game. A "step word" is a valid dictionary word that can be formed by taking a starting word, adding exactly one letter to it, and then rearranging all the letters (forming an anagram).

For example, starting with "apple", you can add "a" to get "applea", which can be rearranged to form the dictionary word "appeal". Thus, "appeal" is a step word for "apple".

My Solution Strategy (Frequency Maps)
The key to solving this efficiently is to realize that anagrams are just words with the exact same character counts. Instead of dealing with complex string rearrangements, I decided to just count the letters.

My plan was simple:

First, I create a "frequency map" for the base word. This is just an array that stores how many 'a's, 'b's, 'c's, etc., the word has. I do this only once at the start.

Then, I go through each word in the provided dictionary.

I immediately skip any word that isn't exactly one letter longer than my base word. This is a quick check that saves a lot of time.

For the words that pass the length test, I create their own frequency map.

Finally, I compare the two maps. If the dictionary word's map has all the same character counts as the base word's map, plus exactly one extra character somewhere, then I know it's a valid step word!

This method is fast because comparing two frequency arrays is much quicker than any complex string manipulation.

Performance Breakdown
Time Complexity: O(N * K), where N is the number of words in the dictionary and K is the maximum word length. This is very efficient because, for each word, I'm just doing a quick pass over its characters to count them.

Space Complexity: O(M * K), where M is the number of valid step words found. This space is used to store the list of results. The frequency maps themselves only take up constant space (O(1)).
